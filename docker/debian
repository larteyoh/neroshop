# vim: filetype=dockerfile:
#
# Install neroshop external libraries
#
# This image is intended to prepare a docker image that contains the external
# libraries pre-installed. The image is parked at
# https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jbakosi/neroshop, which can then be
# pulled by continuous integration (CI) to build and test neroshop. This
# ensures the external libs do not have to be rebuilt, any time neroshop needs
# to be tested, which reduces load on CI.
#
# Usage:
#
# docker build --build-arg COMMIT=gui -f debian -t neroshop --build-arg COMMIT=main --no-cache .
# ~/.local/bin/docker-squash --cleanup neroshop:latest -t jbakosi/neroshop:latest
# docker push jbakosi/neroshop
#

# https://pypi.org/project/docker-squash
