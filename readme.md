# neroshop 

An attempt to create a p2p marketplace for [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) users, which is likely to fail

## About
This is currently a work in progress. There is nothing to see here :shrug:



## Features
* Pseudonymous identities (sellers are only identified by their usernames and trusted based on their reputation)
* No registration required (for buyers only)
* No KYC or AML
* No listing fees
* No sales tax (transaction fees will be paid to miners in place of sales tax. This is crypto after all)
* No other fees (except for miner transaction fees and shipping costs)
* Buy and sell products with Monero [XMR] (and Wownero [WOW] in the near future)
* Seller reputation system
* Product rating system
* Wishlist feature
* End-to-end encrypted messaging system for communications between sellers and buyers
* Distributed p2p network
* Subaddress generator (a unique subaddresses will be generated from a seller's synced wallet account for each order placed by a customer)
* Option to run a local Monero node or connect to remote Monero nodes (so that sellers will not have to sync the entire blockchain)
* Option to choose between sending funds directly to a seller or using an escrow service.
* Tor integration (Internet traffic can be optionally routed through tor for more added privacy)
* And much more ...

### Compiling neroshop from source
1. Install dependencies

Debian/Ubuntu
```sh
sudo -s -- << EOF
# prerequisites
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git
# neroshop, dokun-ui
sudo apt install libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
# monero-cpp (monero)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pkg-config libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev libpgm-dev qttools5-dev-tools libhidapi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libudev-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-locale-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev python3 ccache doxygen graphviz
EOF
```
Arch
```sh
# prerequisites
sudo pacman -Sy --needed base-devel cmake git
# neroshop, dokun-ui
sudo pacman -Sy --needed libx11 lib32-mesa lib32-glu curl openssl
# monero-cpp (monero)
sudo pacman -Syu --needed boost openssl zeromq libpgm unbound libsodium libunwind xz readline ldns expat gtest python3 ccache doxygen graphviz qt5-tools hidapi libusb protobuf systemd
```
Fedora
```sh
# prerequisites
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make cmake git
# neroshop, dokun-ui
sudo dnf install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel
# monero-cpp (monero)
sudo dnf install boost-static libstdc++-static pkgconf boost-devel openssl-devel zeromq-devel openpgm-devel unbound-devel libsodium-devel libunwind-devel xz-devel readline-devel ldns-devel expat-devel gtest-devel ccache doxygen graphviz qt5-linguist hidapi-devel libusbx-devel protobuf-devel protobuf-compiler systemd-devel
```


2. Clone submodules and nested submodules
```sh
cd external
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-cpp.git
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rg3/libbcrypt.git
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator.git
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
cd ../
```

3. Modify external/monero-cpp/external/monero-project/CMakeLists.txt:
`option(BUILD_GUI_DEPS "Build GUI dependencies." ON)`

4. Build monero-project twice to create libwallet_merged.a and other .a libraries
```sh
cd external/monero-cpp/external/monero-project && make release-static && make release-static
cd ../../../../
```

5. Build neroshop (along with dokun-ui)
```sh
# Build dokun-ui
cd external/dokun-ui
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles"
make
cd ../../
# Build neroshop
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```


## Contributions
I can't do everything on my own with my current knowledge and programming skills, so I will need help with some things. Though I am poor as shit (recently got out of NEETdom so yeah ...), I will open a paid bounty program to encourage individuals who have at least some experience in c++ programming to contribute to my project and help bring this project to life.

This is a one-time pay for each task. Payments will be in XMR.

We can negotiate payment if you feel the bounty price is too low.
